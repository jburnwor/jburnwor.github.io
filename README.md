## About
I am a senior at UC Santa Cruz studying Computer Science: Computer Game Design. Throughout school I have worked with small groups to develop teamwork, programming, and design skills. I enjoy developing fun and interesting computer games with creative and motivated people.

### rLDQ (Apr. 2 - June 8, 2018)

Real Life Done Quick is a game about the exhaustion of everyday life and the balance of physical health and speed of succeeding in life. In the form of mini games, the player completes daily tasks on a timer to gain points and avoid losing health. The game follows the repetition of the same daily tasks with repetitive movements throughout the week of someoneâ€™s life. The player must find balance in speed and precision or die rich ignoring their health.

Created with 2 other people in Game Development Experience class. I worked on the design for the mini games involving a physical prototype and playtesting, and programmed 3 of the mini games and the menues.
