Real Life Done Quick is a game about the exhaustion of everyday life and the balance of physical health and speed of succeeding in life. In the form of mini games, the player completes daily tasks on a timer to gain points and avoid losing health. The game follows the repetition of the same daily tasks with repetitive movements throughout the week of someoneâ€™s life. The player must find balance in speed and precision or die rich ignoring their health.

I worked on the design for the mini games involving a physical prototype and playtesting, and programmed 3 of the mini games and the menues.

Tic-Tac-Toe Master is an easy to learn, hard to master variants of the classic game. It includes 4 versions of Tic-Tac-Toe, a cosmetic shop, trackable achievements, match-making. 

I worked on setting up and connecting the firebase database with one of my teammates, create and track the challenges, and set up one of the game board themes.

(The database for accounts is full. In order to play, you can **select the guest account**)

Minigames for arithmetic, fractions, and inequalities made for android phones. Each mini game rewards correct actions with higher scores. Engaging animations to make math fun! 

I worked on design for all the mini games, the artwork for 2 of the games, and programmed smaller functions like the mini games timers.
