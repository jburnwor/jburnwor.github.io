## About
I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Computer Science: Computer Game Design. Throughout school I worked with small groups to develop teamwork, programming, and design skills. I enjoy developing fun and interesting computer games with creative and motivated people.

### House of Styx (Jan 4 - June 7, 2019)
<img src="/img/HoS.jpg" alt="HoS" width="200"/>

House of Styx is a violent, dark surrealist action game where the player takes control of the main character to delve deep into the mind to combat their inner fears and demons. It is a single player pc game made with Unity.

I was a programmer on a team of 13 people, 3 other programmers, 2 voice actors, 1 composer, 4 artists, 1 artist coordinator, and a producer. For most of the project I worked on programming the AI using a finite state machine to create 2 enemy types and a boss, but I also worked on other general tasks like creating particle systems, setting up animator states, and creating a trailer.

### Finley Finds a Home (Jan. 25 - 27, 2019)

Finley Finds a Home is a game for the Global Game Jam about a slug helping a dog find a home. In the game you control a flying dog that can toss items for the dog's home in the air for the slugs to catch. 

I worked with a small team of 6 other people to create this small game, 5 artists and one other programmer. I helped design the concept and I programmed the dog's actions, item spawning and control, and scoring into the game. This was my first ever game jam and first ever unity game. Even though the final turn in for the game was unfinished, I learned a lot about unity and had fun making a quick game with new people.

Real Life Done Quick is a game about the exhaustion of everyday life and the balance of physical health and speed of succeeding in life. In the form of mini games, the player completes daily tasks on a timer to gain points and avoid losing health. The game follows the repetition of the same daily tasks with repetitive movements throughout the week of someoneâ€™s life. The player must find balance in speed and precision or die rich ignoring their health.

Created with 2 other people in Game Development Experience class. I worked on the design for the mini games involving a physical prototype and playtesting, and programmed 3 of the mini games and the menues.
